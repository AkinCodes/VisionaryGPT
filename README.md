VisionaryGPT: AI-Powered Movie Poster Generation & Classification
Welcome to VisionaryGPT ‚Äî a cutting-edge, AI-powered platform for generating, classifying, and extracting metadata from movie posters using state-of-the-art technologies in computer vision, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP).

üöÄ Key Features
Movie Poster Generation
Generate stunning movie posters based on textual prompts, powered by the Stable Diffusion model and CLIP for image generation. This system can take a simple prompt like "Sci-Fi thriller with a futuristic city" and turn it into a dynamic, highly detailed poster.

Poster Classification
Classify movie posters into various genres like Action, Comedy, Drama, Horror, Romance, etc., using deep learning-based classification models integrated with FastAPI.

Metadata Generation
The PosterMetadataGenerator uses CLIP for visual feature extraction and GPT-4 to automatically generate movie metadata based on the poster's features, including:

Title

Genre

Tagline

Mood

2-Sentence Summary

OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
Extract text from posters, enabling you to interact with the text elements of posters, such as extracting movie titles or quotes.

Face Detection & Recognition
Detect and recognize faces on movie posters, allowing for advanced search capabilities. The face recognition feature enables identifying individuals based on facial features, supporting both detection and recognition.

Active Learning
Supports active learning integration, allowing feedback loops where users can improve the classification model and detection capabilities by providing corrections.

Remix Posters
You can remix a poster using a combination of two or more images, enhancing the visual appeal and creativity using generative AI models.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Backend: FastAPI for API creation and deployment

Machine Learning & AI:

CLIP (Contrastive Language‚ÄìImage Pretraining) for image-text matching and metadata generation

Stable Diffusion for text-to-image generation

GPT-4 for metadata and textual description generation

YOLOv8 and other models for object and face detection

Database: SQLAlchemy and SQLModel for managing data, including user information and generated posters

Deployment: Deployed on Render (or other platforms) using Docker, with CI/CD pipelines in place for streamlined updates.

üí° Project Purpose
VisionaryGPT was designed to leverage cutting-edge AI technology to streamline the generation, classification, and understanding of movie posters. By combining vision and language models, the project provides:

Enhanced creativity for users looking to generate movie posters based on creative text inputs.

Automated movie classification to assist with large-scale movie poster datasets.

Intelligent metadata generation to enrich movie posters with context, improving both user experience and automated tagging.

üñºÔ∏è How It Works
FastAPI Endpoints
POST /embed/: Embed an image for feature extraction using CLIP.

POST /remix/: Remix movie posters via combination of A, B, and C poster images.

POST /classify/: Classify movie genre based on the poster.

POST /ocr/: Extract text from an image (OCR).

POST /metadata/: Generate metadata like title, genre, tagline, and summary from a poster.

POST /generation/: Generate a movie poster using a textual description (e.g., "A Sci-Fi thriller set in a futuristic city").

POST /feedback/: Store user feedback on predictions.

POST /faces/: Detect and recognize faces in movie posters.

POST /detect/: Detect objects in posters.

POST /auth/: Register and login users for personalized experiences.

POST /active_learning/corrections: Store corrections from users to improve model performance.

POST /simple-test/: Simple testing endpoint for model validation.

üéØ Purpose for Silicon Valley Recruiters
This project has been crafted with modern best practices in software architecture, machine learning pipelines, and robust APIs to showcase my expertise in full-stack AI and computer vision projects. It demonstrates:

Innovative AI Integration: I have integrated several advanced AI models (GPT-4, CLIP, YOLO, Stable Diffusion) into a seamless and scalable API.

Scalability & Performance: The backend built using FastAPI ensures performance, while deployment on Render with Docker ensures easy scalability and a production-grade application.

User-Centric AI: By adding face recognition, OCR, and active learning features, I‚Äôve enhanced user experience and feedback loops.
