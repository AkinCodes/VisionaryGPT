VisionaryGPT: AI-Powered Movie Poster Generation & Classification
Welcome to VisionaryGPT, an AI-powered platform designed to generate, classify, and extract metadata from movie posters using cutting-edge technologies in computer vision, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP). This project demonstrates the integration of AI models and FastAPI, enabling advanced movie poster generation and categorization.

üöÄ Key Features
Movie Poster Generation:
Generate stunning movie posters from textual prompts using Stable Diffusion model and CLIP for image generation. Example prompts like "Sci-Fi thriller with a futuristic city" can be transformed into highly detailed and dynamic posters.

Poster Classification:
Classify movie posters into genres such as Action, Comedy, Drama, Horror, Romance, etc., using deep learning-based classification models integrated with FastAPI.

Metadata Generation:
Using CLIP for visual feature extraction and GPT-4 for automated movie metadata generation. Automatically generate movie details including:

Title

Genre

Tagline

Mood

2-Sentence Summary

OCR (Optical Character Recognition):
Extract text from movie posters, enabling interaction with text elements such as movie titles, quotes, and descriptions.

Face Detection & Recognition:
Detect and recognize faces on movie posters for advanced search capabilities, enabling recognition based on facial features.

Active Learning:
Supports feedback loops that allow users to improve model performance by submitting corrections, enhancing classification models and detection capabilities.

Remix Posters:
Remix multiple posters using a combination of A + B - C, creatively generating new, customized movie posters.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Backend: FastAPI (for API creation and deployment)

Machine Learning & AI:

CLIP for image-text matching and metadata generation

Stable Diffusion for text-to-image generation

GPT-4 for metadata and textual description generation

YOLOv8 for object and face detection

Database: SQLAlchemy and SQLModel (for data management, user information, and generated posters)

Deployment: Render (or similar platforms) using Docker, with CI/CD pipelines for streamlined updates.

üí° Project Purpose
VisionaryGPT is designed to leverage cutting-edge AI technology to streamline the generation, classification, and understanding of movie posters. By combining vision models (CLIP, YOLO) with language models (GPT-4), the platform offers:

Enhanced creativity for users looking to generate visually stunning movie posters.

Automated classification of large-scale movie poster datasets.

Smart metadata generation to enrich movie posters with context and improve automated tagging.

üñºÔ∏è How It Works
FastAPI Endpoints:
POST /embed/: Embed an image for feature extraction using CLIP.

POST /remix/: Remix movie posters using multiple images (A + B - C).

POST /classify/: Classify the genre of a movie poster.

POST /ocr/: Extract text from an image (OCR).

POST /metadata/: Generate metadata like title, genre, tagline, and summary from a poster.

POST /generation/: Generate a movie poster using a textual description.

POST /feedback/: Store user feedback on predictions.

POST /faces/: Detect and recognize faces in movie posters.

POST /detect/: Detect objects in posters.

POST /auth/: Register and log in users for personalized experiences.

POST /active_learning/corrections: Save corrections from users to improve model performance.

POST /simple-test/: Simple testing endpoint for model validation.

üéØ Purpose for Silicon Valley Recruiters
This project is designed to showcase expertise in full-stack AI, computer vision, and NLP with a focus on scalable, production-ready solutions. It demonstrates:

Innovative AI Integration: Integrating GPT-4, CLIP, YOLO, and Stable Diffusion to build an advanced system that bridges text and image generation.

Scalability & Performance: Built with FastAPI for high-performance APIs and deployed on Render with Docker for easy scalability.

User-Centric AI: Enhancing user experience with active learning, face recognition, and OCR for better interaction and continuous model improvement.

Testing the Endpoints:
You can test all the FastAPI endpoints directly via the Swagger UI on your local machine. Here, you can explore and interact with the API using a visual interface for easy testing. Each POST endpoint can be tested with relevant parameters such as image file paths, prompts, and other required data. This functionality ensures you can verify the system‚Äôs capability to generate posters, classify them, extract metadata, and much more, all from a simple, user-friendly dashboard!
